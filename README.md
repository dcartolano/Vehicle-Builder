# Vehicle-Builder

## Description

This app aims to create a UI in the terminal through which a user can enter vehicles with select data, and perform a few actions for a vehicle of their choosing, sometimes based on the information entered. 

This project was primarily focused on getting more practice with object oriented programming, and learning more about how to use assocciated classes, methods, and relationships.
